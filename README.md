## General info
I have been playing chess since elementary school and ever since learning to code, have wanted to make my own Chess Engine. This is my take on a chess engine. Eventually, I will also create a chess bot, so that you can play against a computer.

## Technologies
* Python 3.9.13
* pygame 2.5.2

## TODO
- [ ] Implement Check, Checkmate, and Stalemates
- [ ] Add timer for blitz/speed chess
- [ ] Cleaning up the code - Separate into different files and functions
- [ ] Optimize code - Using dictionaries, numpy array
- [ ] Stalemate on 3 repeated moves or 50 moves without capture/pawn advancement.
- [ ] Main menu to select game mode (player vs player/computer), customize board colours, change piece styles
- [ ] Add in recording and viewing functionality - save a log of past chess games using notation so that they can be reviewed at a later date
